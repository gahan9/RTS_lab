\section{What Programming Language to choose?}\label{section:chosse-language}
So far the paper explained the \rtsS model, component and significance of programming in \rts.
There are lot of programming languages available for normal software development such as Assembly language, C, C++, Java, Python, GO, Pearl, Ruby, R etc. However not every language fits by the needs of Real-Time application. As already described the desired five requirements for \rtsS in Section \ref{section:issues-in-programming-environment} not all language guarantees all the five requirements and we have to eliminate those language.

Programming languages for \rtsS can be classified as below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assembly Languages
    \item Sequential systems implementation languages -- e.g. RTL/2, Coral 66, Jovial, C.
    \item High-level concurrent languages -- e.g. Ada, Chill, Modula-2, Mesa, Java.
\end{itemize}
where in assembly languages and sequential systems implementation languages require operating systems support whereas High-level concurrent languages does not. Also High-level concurrent languages are impetus from the software crisis.

As a result below are listed popular languages available for programming of \rts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Java/Real-Time Java 
    \item C and Real-Time POSIX
    \item Ada 95
    \item Also Modula-1 for device driving
\end{itemize}
