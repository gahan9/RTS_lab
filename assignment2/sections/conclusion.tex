\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}
In this paper we have described the model of \rtsS model in Section \ref{section:rts-model} followed by the issues for programming environment and explained significance of programming in \rtsS. In Section \ref{section:choose-programming=language} and the same section describes some fixes that could be done if one desires to use Python to develop \rts. As a result we can conclude that predictability is highly concerned requirement for \rtsS and programmer must manage everything in code explicitly to achieve predictability.
